# Subnetting Tool

## Overview

This project is a subnetting tool designed to facilitate the calculation of IP address subnets using both dotted notation and CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. With this tool, users can quickly and accurately determine subnet addresses, subnet masks, network addresses, broadcast addresses, and available IP ranges for a given IP address and subnet mask or CIDR notation.

## Features

- **Subnet Calculation:** Calculate subnet addresses, subnet masks, network addresses, broadcast addresses, and available IP ranges.
- **Support for Dotted Notation:** Input IP addresses and subnet masks in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
- **Support for CIDR Notation:** Input IP addresses and subnet masks in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
- **Output Formatting:** Display results in a clear and concise format for easy interpretation.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface:** Utilize a user-friendly command-line interface for input and output.

## Installation

This tool can be installed and run locally on your machine.
